          * Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers
          receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at a
          Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may
          vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible
          Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While
          supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to
          the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible
          Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including
          the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt
          and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI)
          purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a
          0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at
          checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift
          Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one
          ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product
          discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan
          over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total
          combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans
          will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product.
          Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the
          Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the
          Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR
          payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in
          the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations,
          apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is
          subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
          support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about eligible
          products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple
          Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and or after August 1,
          2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24%
          to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2024.
          Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates
          and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in
          full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject
          to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI
          purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an
          iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as
          your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is
          always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not
          available for purchases made online at the following special stores:
          Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee
          Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and
          Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices.
          The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s
          purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount.
          ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason,
          including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible
          products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about
          upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple Card Customer
          Agreement for more information about ACMI financing. Apple Card is
          issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available for
          qualifying applicants in the United States. If you reside in the U.S.
          territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions
